# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



This Project is a Password Generator. Using this, you can choose randomly generated passwords with or without numbers or special characters and finally you can copy them to your clipboard as well!!
There is also a small popup which indicates that your password has been copied.
This Project is also done with the collaboration of TailwindCSS.
This project gives a great insight on the usage of React Hooks such as useCallback, useEffect, useState.
